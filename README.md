### Hi there, I'm Pascale 👋🏾 

A technologist by DNA, with a background in product, strategy, sales and engineering. I love the entire process of developing creative ideas, whether they be my own or others. When it comes to 🧠,  I subscribe to Kaizen philosophy, I enjoy learning new things, always willing to find creative solutions. 

🥇 Since I hung up spikes as a professional triple jumper 🏃🏾‍♀️ I have even more time to spend learning, creating and building :cool: things :fireworks:. 
🛑 Don't get it twisted I'm still 🏋🏾‍♀️ (and yes probably "can beat you in a race" and "squat more than you") #TeamFit4life

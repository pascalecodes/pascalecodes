### Hi there, I'm Pascale 👋🏾 

A technologist by DNA, with a background in product, strategy, sales and engineering. 
I love the entire process of developing creative websites. I love the challenge of finding caches and spending time to meet new people. Learning how people hide things and where people are likely to look. A creative, detail-oriented, software developer with a deep interest in AI and integrating 3D modeling in web design.

Quick learner who enjoys experimenting with new technology. Able to switch between perfectionism and pragmatism. Agile software development, teamwork, extremely passionate about design. Always willing and able to think outside the box.

🥇 Since I hung up spikes as a professional triple jumper 🏃🏾‍♀️ I have even more time to spend learning, creating and building :cool: things :fireworks: but don't get it twisted I'm still 🏋🏾‍♀️ (and yes "can beat you in a race" and "squat more than you") #TeamFit4life

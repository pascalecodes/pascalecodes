A technologist by DNA, with a background in product, strategy, sales and engineering. I love the entire process of developing creative ideas, whether they be my own or others.  When it comes to 🧠 I subscribe to Kaizen philosophy, I enjoy learning new things, always willing to find creative solutions. 

🥇 Since I hung up spikes as a professional triple jumper 🏃🏾‍♀️ I have even more time to spend learning, creating and building :cool: things :fireworks: but don't get it twisted I'm still 🏋🏾‍♀️ (and yes "can beat you in a race" and "squat more than you") #TeamFit4life
